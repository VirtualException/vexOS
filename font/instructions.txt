If you wish to generate your own font for vexOS, based on a terminal/monospaced
font, do the following:

1.  Find a font that u can print on a terminal without any antialiasing. My
    recommendation: Limit yourself to tty fonts.

2.  Get its size (width and height)

3.  Open the terminal (or tty) and print all the ascii characters with:
    "printf "$(printf \\%03o $(seq 32 126))\n" | fold -w 1"

4.  Make a screenshot of the result with, in case of tty,
    "fbgrab [FONTNAME].png"

5.  Now, edit the [FONTNAME].png file in gimp to make all pixels white-iss
    white (and all black-iss black).

6.  Export the [FONTNAME].png as C source and in RGBA mode. U will only need
    the "pixel_data" content of the file.

7.  Modify the font.h file as required, adding the "pixel_data" and font
    information.

(good luck windows users)
